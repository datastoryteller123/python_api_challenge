WeatherPy Conclusions
1. There is a strong negative correlation between the Northern Hemisphere Latitude and Max Temperature.

2. The Southern Hemisphere has a relative positive correlation, which both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere comparison to the Max Temperature reveals the closer you are to the equator will result in higher temperatures.

3. The humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed didn't have any conclusive information, as the correlation is relatively weak.
